                <g> Saint Laurent was born on 1 August 1936, in Oran, French Algeria, to French parents, Charles and Lucienne Andrée Mathieu-Saint-Laurent. 
                He grew up in a villa by the Mediterranean with his two younger sisters, Michèle and Brigitte.
             Saint Laurent liked to create intricate paper dolls, and by his early teen years, he was designing dresses for his mother and sisters. 
             At the age of 17, Saint Laurent moved to Paris and enrolled at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture, where his designs quickly gained notice.
             <g>  Michel De Brunhoff, the editor of French Vogue, introduced Saint Laurent to designer Christian Dior, a giant in the fashion world.

                <g> "Dior fascinated me," Saint Laurent later recalled. "I couldn't speak in front of him. He taught me the basis of my art. 
                 Whatever was to happen next, I never forgot the years I spent at his side." 
                 Under Dior's tutelage, Saint Laurent's style continued to mature and gain even more notice.</g> <br>
                <br>
                 <g>In 1953, Saint Laurent submitted three sketches to a contest for young fashion designers organized by the International Wool Secretariat. Saint Laurent won first place.
                      Subsequently, he was invited to attend the awards ceremony held in Paris in December of that same year.[9] During his stay in Paris, Saint Laurent met Michel de Brunhoff (who was then editor-in-chief of the French edition of Vogue magazine and a connection to his father). 
                      De Brunhoff, known by some as a considerate person who encouraged new talent, was impressed by the sketches that Saint Laurent brought with him and suggested he should intend to become a fashion designer. Saint Laurent would eventually consider a course of study at the Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture,
                       the council which regulates the haute couture industry and provides training to its employees. </g> <br>
                 <br>
                     <g>Saint Laurent followed his advice and, leaving Oran for Paris after graduation, began his studies there and eventually graduated as a star pupil. 
                     Later, that same year, he entered the International Wool Secretariat competition again and won, beating out his friend Fernando Sánchez and young German student Karl Lagerfeld.</g> <br>
                     <br>
                     <g>
                     Shortly after his win, he brought a number of sketches to de Brunhoff who recognized close similarities to sketches he had been shown that morning by Christian Dior. Knowing that Dior had created the sketches that morning and that the young man could not have seen them, de Brunhoff sent him to Dior, who hired him on the spot.
                n 1957, Saint Laurent found himself at age 21 the head designer of the House of Dior. His spring 1958 collection almost certainly saved the enterprise from financial ruin; the straight line of his creations, a softer version of Dior's New Look, catapulted him to international stardom with what would later be known as the "trapeze dress". Others, included in the collection, were dresses with a narrow shoulder and flared gently at the bottom. At that time, he shortened his surname to Saint Laurent because the international press found his hyphenated triple name difficult to express.
