     <h1>Intro-Questions</h1>
    <p> 1. My name is Cydney Bibbs. I am currently a junior studying Communication Design.</p>

    <p> 2. I took this course because I am interested in Interaction Design as a career choice. </p>

    <p> 3. I have a little expereince with JS. The most I understand now is syntax and how to read code. </p>

    <p> 4. I hope to become more proffecient in problem solving and creating designs using code.</p>

    <p> 5. I believe designing on the screen allows for interactive elements, such as movement, to take place, unlike on paper.</p>

    <p> 6. Link to effective design: <a href="https://nicholasjackson.design/"> Nicholas Jackson Design</a>
    </p>  
    <p>   I think this website is very well organized and visually eye-catching. I also like 
            how it has interactive elements within the beginning which allows the designer to
            showcase their skill.</p>

    <p> 7. Link to website with effective communication: <a href="https://simplychocolate.dk/"> Simply Chocolate </a>
        <p> I think this website is great at displaying the product that is being sold.
            By using the bar as the main center point, customers are able to understand what
            they are able to purchase on the site. 
        </p>

    <p> 8. Link to website that I think works well: <a href="https://moa.ie/"> MOA</a>
        <p>I think this website works well due to its simplicity. Everything on the website is sectioned off based 
            on the content, which made it easier to navigate.
