            <h2>Links</h2>
            <h3>Food Websites</h3>
               <p> <a href="https://www.yummly.com/"> Yummly's </a> recipie website has a very clear navigation system. THe webiste is also very clean looking and easy to read.</p>
               <p> I like how <a href="https://www.delish.com/"> Delish </a> Uses the entire screen at the very beginning to showcase the food that can be created. Very visually interesting.
                    I also like the usage of videos on the website that gived instructions on how to create these recipies.</p>
                    <p>I like how  <a href="https://www.yeprecipes.com/"> Yeprecipies </a> made their images to look like photogrpahs. It steers away from the typical recipie websites that I have seen, and is fun to look at.</p>
            <h3>Other Websites</h3>  
            <p> <a href="https://wideawake.earth/shop"> Wide Awake </a> uses a single page in order to display their clothing. Since we are limited to one page for our website, I though it would be good to look at websites that use a few pages.</p>
            <p> <a href="https://www.mariodragicevic.com/"> Mario Dragicevic's</a> website has a lot of cool interactive elements. These elements offer different way of navigating the same information, which I find really cool.</p>
            <p> <a href="http://www.cyclemon.com/"> Cycle Mon's </a> website also takes advantage of only a few pages to display their products. I like that they use a fixed image throguhout the first page and chagne the background to display the passing of time and different settings. </p>
